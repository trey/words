- [A Tribe Called Quest &mdash; &ldquo;We got it from Here&#8230; Thank You 4 Your Service&rdquo;](http://atribecalledquest.com/stream-we-got-it-from-here-thank-you-4-your-service-now/)
    - Their first album in 18 years is out today! It was such a pleasant surprise to learn about this just a few days ago. I stand by [what I said then](https://twitter.com/trey/status/791816649041145856). Be sure to read [the excellent NYT article about the making of the album](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/06/arts/music/a-tribe-called-quest-new-album-interview.html) and watch [the video they released today (so good!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAoqWu6wmfI)

    - Lots of people have been talking about [wearing safety pins in solidarity](http://kottke.org/16/11/safety-pins-as-a-symbol-of-solidarity-against-racism) to people who feel alienated and marginalized by [our new president](http://mlkshk.com/p/1AA8G) and what he stands for. If it's good enough for Captain Picard, it's good enough for me.

    - > There is very little one can think to say, after reading this secular saint [Thomas Jefferson]’s testimony on beauty and race, except that we might bear his words in mind on a visit to a major Western art museum where an idea of beauty is everywhere apparent — one in which black skin has had no place.
- [I got my first batch of Instax monochrome film this week.](https://twitter.com/trey/status/796738443464310784) It's exciting that Fuji is releasing new film instead of just discontinuing the old.
