I've been meaning to write about my experiences with the X-T10. I think someone may have even specifically asked me to, so here it is.

After using it for over a month, I decided to send it back. It was _ok_, but what finally made me decide to send it back was that it would occasionally not register the EVF when I brought the camera up to my eye. This was at first subtly frustrating and then kind of maddening.

## Pros

- Feels like a real camera. Metal body and dials.
- Aperture ring on lens.
    - This was originally one of the big selling points for me (all the film camera-style dials), but I find it a bit gimmicky now. It's not harder to look at the back of the camera or through the viewfinder to see what your settings are. And since the manual focus on the lens is "by-wire," you can't do the cool thing you can do with real manual lenses and adjust the focal range to shoot "from the hip" when walking around.
    - It's still really cool looking.
- Film simulation modes are kind of cool.
- Body itself if pretty inexpensive considering what it's _supposed_ to be.
- It does take nice photos.

## Cons

- Aforementioned issue with the EVF not always registering when I brought it up to my eye.
- Hard to figure out how to reliably get an image in focus and exposed correctly. ([This tutorial][xt10-tutorial] helped.)
    - Seriously, I've never had this much trouble getting a digital camera to do the right thing.
- While the film simulation modes are cool, it's not obvious how to use them if you shoot raw. [^1]
    - You'll see the mode you shot the image in briefly in Lightroom and then it'll disappear. To get it back, you have to dig through settings panels and then remember what mode you were using. If you shot tons of pictures, it's quite a tedious process.
- Lens prices are insane. If you're going to spend this kind of dough on camera pieces, it feels like a sucker's game not to be using a real DSLR.

My mindset when getting this camera was that if the X100 series is so lauded, then the "same" thing with interchangeable lenses should be **better**. Well, I don't think that's the case. They're uglier (subjective, I know) and louder (the X100 series leaf shutter is beautifully quiet--it's like using a proper rangefinder). Every time I see Livie's X100T, I think "That is a handsome camera." I usually found the X-T10 to be quirkily retro at best and homely at worst. If you're going to go for a retro look, I think rangefinders look cooler than film SLRs (yes, also subjective).
