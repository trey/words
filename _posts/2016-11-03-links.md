- [College of Charleston Professor Alison Piepmeier Leaves a Lesson of Love](http://today.cofc.edu/2016/11/02/alison-piepmeier/)
    - A posthumous article by my sister. Alison apparently started this a month or so before she died and it was then heavily edited by [Brian](http://president.cofc.edu/administration/officersanddeans/brian-mcgee.php) (her language abilities were very limited by that point). The illustration was a surprise--I'm trying to figure out how I can get a print of it.
- [Intrepid Camera](https://intrepidcamera.co.uk/products/intrepid-camera)
    - Last New Years Eve, one of the things I talked about wanting to do in 2016 was to get into large format photography. It's now the beginning of November and I haven't started. The time is nigh (although it probably won't come together until January 2017 at the earliest). I heard about this camera listening to [the latest episode of the Film Photography Podcast](http://filmphotographyproject.com/podcast/2016/11/film-photography-podcast-153).
- [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org/)
    - I'm thinking of setting up a photography forum to have a (non-Facebook, non-Slack) place for quality, threaded conversations. I would use Discourse because it seems like that's the nicest version of modern forum software and it's made by [one of the people who started Stack Exchange](https://blog.codinghorror.com/civilized-discourse-construction-kit/).
- [Daring Fireball: Michael Tsai's Roundup of Commentary on the New MacBook Pros and the State of the Mac](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/10/31/tsai-mbp-roundup)
    - I've been enjoying the Apple backlash about the new MacBook Pro (and [I've joined in a bit](https://twitter.com/trey/status/791703543979859968)), but I may still end up getting one. I'm overdue for a new machine.
